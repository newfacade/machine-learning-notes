    "\n",
    "A slightly more general definition by Arthur Samuel in 1959:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without beging explicitly programmed.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Common definition by Tom Mitchell in 1988:\n",
    "\n",
    "**A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performace measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.**"
